# Sliding Windows

## Overview

This tutorial covers sliding windows of data. Sliding, like tumbling windows,
are uniform across subjects but overlap with each other. If you want a user's
total page views during the last seven days but want that data updated every
minute you want a sliding window.

If you've used other stream processing engines you may have been burned by
sliding windows. If you plan to process about 100 MB of data in each window for
a week and want to slide it by a minute, a naive implementation would result in
1 TB of data in state. The trick is to do some aggregation by bucket as events
arrive and progressively drop data from the tail of a sliding window while
adding it to the head.

More than tumbling windows, there's some nuance to sliding windows. For instance
if just one event arrives for a user is it critical to emit all 10,080 windows
for a minute-sliding week or do we just care when the value changes?

As we implement this "total page views count by user in the last seven days"
feature, we'll focus on the common use case of keeping a database fresh. This
means that we only need to emit data for a window when the value changes.

For this job, the incoming events represent page view events by a user:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user-a",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T12:45:10Z"
}
```

And our goal is to emit a new event with the weekly sum every minute:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user-a",
  "total_views": 5
}
```

## Keying Events

First we'll make a function to transform our JSON page view events into
Reduction's `KeyedEvent` type.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeSnippet language="go" code={slidingWindowHandler} marker="key-event" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeSnippet language="typescript" code={handlerTypeScript} marker="key-event" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating the Operator Handler

For this handler's state, we'll store the sum of the page views by minute in a
map. We'll also store the previous sum window's sum so that we can avoid
emitting events if the sum hasn't changed between windows.

Our sink will take a `SumEvent` type to collect the results of each window.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeSnippet language="go" code={slidingWindowHandler} marker="handler" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeSnippet language="typescript" code={handlerTypeScript} marker="handler" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Processing Each Event

In `OnEvent` we'll load the map state, increment the sum for the event's minute,
and set a timer to fire on the next minute.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeSnippet language="go" code={slidingWindowHandler} marker="on-event" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeSnippet language="typescript" code={handlerTypeScript} marker="on-event" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

So whenever an event comes in, we'll set a timer for the next minute. This works
as long as we have a steady stream of events invoking the `OnEvent` method for
this key but we also need to consider what happens when the events stop for this
user. We still need to collect new data as the windows continue to slide and the
total number of events decreases. We could set a timer for every future sliding
window this event will be part of but for our use case we can minimize the
number of timers by setting a timer in the `OnTimerExpired` method.

## Processing Timers

When a timer fires, we'll sum all buckets relevant for the current window,
remove any obsolete minute buckets from our map, and only emit when the total
changes.

Let's write the `OnTimerExpired` method to send these events:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeSnippet language="go" code={slidingWindowHandler} marker="on-timer" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeSnippet language="typescript" code={handlerTypeScript} marker="on-timer" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

One optimization here (highlighted) is that we only set another timer when there
is some value in the window. When there's no data in the map, we can rely on any
new event setting another timer.

Also notice that when we set the next timer, we set it based on the current
watermark and not just the expired timer value. Remember that to be completely
correct we should assume that timers can fire arbitrarily late. If a timer fires
more than a minute late and we set a timer for the following minute based on
that value, that next timer will be dropped if it's past the watermark.

:::note[Watermarks]
Watermark is short for "low watermark" and is a common concept in stream
processing. Incoming events don't have to be in strict order, but at some point
the job has to decide when it can safely fire a timer and expect to have seen
all the earlier events. That moving threshold is the watermark.
:::

## Testing

For our testing we can use the `TestRun` utility to get the results of running
our handler against a set of ViewEvents.

We'll set up our job with a source, sink, and operator with our handler. This
is where we configure the two State Specs:
* `countsByMinute`: Map Spec of timestamps to counts
* `previousWindowSum`: Value Spec for a number

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeSnippet language="go" code={slidingWindowTest} marker="job-setup" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeSnippet language="typescript" code={handlerTestTypeScript} marker="job-setup" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then we set up our test run with a series of ViewEvents to process.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeSnippet language="go" code={slidingWindowTest} marker="test-run" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeSnippet language="typescript" code={handlerTestTypeScript} marker="test-run" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The use of events with another key ("other-user") and the watermarks demonstrate
how event time and watermarks progress in the absence of events for "user". Other
timestamped events and periodic watermarks continue to mark the passage of time and
allow relevant timers to fire.

Finally we can assert on the events in the `memorySink`.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeSnippet language="go" code={slidingWindowTest} marker="assert" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeSnippet language="typescript" code={handlerTestTypeScript} marker="assert" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Wrapping Up

Often teams start with a daily batch SQL job and find that running it more
frequently would be valuable. Maybe twice a day? Every hour? Stream processing
with sliding windows can dramatically increase the freshness of data.

Although a high-level API for sliding windows could be built on top of the
`OnEvent` and `OnTimerExpired` methods, I hope you can see how the specifics of
a use case lead to optimizations or custom business rules that would be
difficult to express in a format like SQL.
