# Deployment With CDK

This guide shows you how to deploy a Reduction cluster with CDK that calls a
Handler service.

## Building Job Handler and Config

The Reduction Handler code that you write defines the job's configuration and
creates the Handler Service that the reduction engine calls. To deploy you'll
first want to build the handler code and write the job configuration file. You
can do this anywhere you like in your CI process but for this example we'll
build these artifacts as part of the CDK synthesis process.

Building the handler executable:

```
<building snippet>
```

Writing the config file to disk:

```
<config run snippet>
```
