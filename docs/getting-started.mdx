# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up your environment and run your first Reduction job.

## Installation

The Reduction CLI can be installed with homebrew:

```bash
brew install reduction-dev/tap/reduction
```

Or downloaded and run with one of these pre-built binaries:

<ul>
   <DownloadLinks version={currentVersion}>
      {({ key, url, displayName }) => (
         <li key={key}>
            <a href={url}>{`${currentVersion} - ${displayName}`}</a>
         </li>
      )}
   </DownloadLinks>
</ul>

Make sure you have `reduction` in your path:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session">
{`$ reduction --version 
reduction version ${currentVersion}`}
</CodeBlock>

## Setup

Create a new Go project and add the Reduction Go SDK as a dependency. For example:

```bash
mkdir myjob && cd myjob
go mod init myjob
go get reduction.dev/reduction-go
```

## Author a Job

As a demo we'll create job that counts all the events from an embedded source of
incrementing numbers and prints to stdout every 100,000th event it processes.
Don't worry about the specifics of the job code yet, let's just get something
running.

<CodeBlock language="go">{quickStartMain}</CodeBlock>

## Running a Job

Try out the job:

1. Build the job:

   ```bash
   go build
   ```

2. Run the job with `reduction-dev`:
   
   ```bash
   reduction dev ./myjob
   ```

At this point you should see a line printed to the terminal for every 100,000th
event processed.
